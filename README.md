# morph-zipf-lab


Do morpheme (subword) frequencies obey Zipf-like laws? How do their tails
compare to words across corpora?

- Two segmentation tracks: Morfessor (unsupervised) + optional lexicon
- Fits: power law vs lognormal vs Yule–Simon (α, xmin, KS, LLR)
- Heaps' law, hapax/dis, Gini, Lorenz; word→morpheme concentration

Quickstart:
- setup
- toy   # runs end-to-end on a tiny English sample
